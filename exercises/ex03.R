# The exercise here is to display the sine wave in a color and the cosine wave in another color
# You will first create a sequence from 0 to 20 by 0.1

# Your code

# Now, create variables equivalent to the sine and cosine of this sequence

# Your code

# You can now display those variables on a graph
# Draw the sine line in red and the cosine line in blue

# Your code
