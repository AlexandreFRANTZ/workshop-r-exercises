# In order to familiarize with the language, we'll see how functions work
# First, create an addition function, taking a list as parameter and returning the sum of each node of the list
# As a good developer, you can do it recursively :)

# Your code

# Now do the same with the substraction and the multiplication

# Your code

# Now, we'll create an array of 10 random numbers between 1 and 3, that will represent our operation manager
# Create also an array containing 10 arrays of 20 random numbers from -30 to 30 (outside a function)

# Your code

# Create now a for loop outside any function, looping on the operator list
# Inside this loop, you have 3 different cases:
# 1 -> print the result of the addition function using the correct index of the double array
# 2 -> print the result of the substraction function using the correct index of the double array
# 3 -> print the result of the multiplication function using the correct index of the double array
# Print it as followed:
# $ The operator Addition (1) of the list of index 0 has given 231.
# Don't forget to replace Addition by Substraction or Multiplication if necessary, replace the 0 between parentheses by the operator value, the index by the real index and the last number by the result

# Your code
